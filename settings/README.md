# settings

A collection of helper routines and classes that are used by naomi.settings
to provide high-level binary manipulation of EEPROM files. Note that while
these routines could be used to manipulate Naomi SRAM files or other arbitrary
binary data there has been no effort to generalize them further than the present.
